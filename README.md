# Crop-Prediction
This project is about predicting which crop is best fitted to be planted based on the climatic condition as well as the soil content. The model can be used to help farmers in choosing the right crop.
->NPK- Ratio of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium in the soil.
->Temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
->Relative humidity - relative humidity in %
->pH - pH value of the soil
->Rainfall - rainfall measured in mm
The model is successfully deployed on Heroku.
EDA part is succesfully visualized on power-Bi
